Obviously this is because of the 20x futures on Okcoin. Probably some closing of shorts etc etc  But I was also thinking (maybe a conspiracy theory) that miners could be using a ""pump and dump"" scheme by dumping on Huobi and then pumping using the Okcoin futures before another dump.  What do u guys think? not miners may be some chinese billionaire using pump and dump  ;)  Yeah right, because they have time to play around for pennies?

The scheme had a price tag of 500 litecoins to enter and promised high returns of passive income.  This is the address of the ponzi scheme, which shows that it had a total of over 9 million LTC valued at around $40 million dollars. There are only 40,694,504 litecoins in existence, which means that this scheme managed to accumulate 22% of all litecoins!  The buying pressure came from over 10,000 Chinese investors which definitely explains why the price shot up so quickly.

Yes. Very much. If there are no negative events in Bitcoin security and regulatory landscape I'm looking for Bitcoin to make new highs in 2016 (relative to 2015) in a conservative scenario. In an optimistic scenario I think it can touch $1000 or come very close to this figure. In any case I do expect the bullish trend to continue fueled by: 1. Increased adoption as revealed by more transactions in the network. 2. Increased hashing power and hence increased security and therefore higher value of the network. 3. Reduction of supply of new asset supply due to halving by mid 2016.  Of course in the short term anything can happen as any trader with a significant position can push the price up or down.
